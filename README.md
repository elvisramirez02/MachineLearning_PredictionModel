# Machine Learning - Prediction Model
About the Problem Statement

The main objective of this analysis is to leverage the dataset, containing information such as work years, experience level, employment type, job title, salary details, employee residence, remote work ratio, company location, and company size, to create a machine learning model. Based on the provided data profiles, this model will be specifically developed to accurately predict salaries for different job positions. This study aims to provide precise insights into the current salary trajectories within the data science realm by examining the complex interconnections among various factors.

Furthermore, the implementation of this machine learning model can significantly improve a company's process. By utilizing the predictions generated by the model, the company can enhance its salary structuring and decision-making processes. The model can assist in determining competitive compensation packages, optimizing resource allocation, and aligning salaries with industry standards.
